# About Shizuka

**Shizuka** is a minimalist static site generator (SSG) inspired by the character Shizuka from *君のことが大大大大大好きな100人の彼女*. Much like the character it’s named after, Shizuka is small, quiet, and loves reading.

Shizuka is designed to be very general; whether you’re setting up a personal blog, a project showcase, or just a space to collect your thoughts, Shizuka is designed to make the process of building and maintaining your site simple.

## Features

- **Markdown/HTML first**: Write your content in markdown, design page templates in HTML, and Shizuka takes care of the rest.
- **Minimalist Design**: No unnecessary bloat – just the essentials for building a fast, lightweight site.
- **Out of Your Way**: The main focus of Shizuka's design was to stay out of the way when you are designing a site.
- **Customizable**: Shizuka includes a simple default template to get you started, but supports easy and powerful customization for your own unique design.
- **CLI Tooling**: Manage your site with ease using Shizuka’s commands:
   - `init`: Set up a new project with a single command.
   - `build`: Compile your markdown into a fully functional static site.
   - `dev`: Start a local development server with live reloading.
   - `serve`: Preview a built site before deploying.

## Why Choose Shizuka?

If you’re looking for an SSG that’s as dependable and charming as its namesake, Shizuka is here to quietly and efficiently help you build your webpage.
